# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains projects developed using **Python** as part of an advanced machine learning unit. The unit covers both conventional and state-of-the-art techniques, including classifiers, regression models, and deep learning approaches.

## ðŸ§  Overview

The unit builds on prior machine learning knowledge and focuses on:

- Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest)  
- Deep learning architectures  
- Transformer-based models for NLP  
- Feature extraction and regularisation techniques

## ðŸ§ª Projects

### 1. **Penguin Species Classification**

- **Dataset**: Palmer Archipelago penguin data  
- **Objective**: Predict penguin species based on features like bill length, flipper length, and body mass  
- **Models**: KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- **Techniques**: Model comparison, accuracy evaluation, cross-validation

### 2. **Transformer for Machine Translation**

- **Task**: Sequence-to-sequence neural machine translation  
- **Model**: Transformer architecture  
- **Skills**: Attention mechanisms, positional encoding, translation quality evaluation

### 3. **Emotion Classification from Facial Images**

- **Goal**: Classify emotions using both conventional and deep learning techniques  
- **Conventional ML**: HOG/HOF/MBH feature descriptors + ML classifiers  
- **Deep Learning**: CNNs with regularisation techniques (e.g. Monte Carlo Dropout)  
- **Focus**: Feature extraction, model tuning, overfitting control
